Why is a Version Control System useful when developing software both as an individual developer and as part of a development team?

A version control system is useful when developing both individually and within a team as along the way of your development (individually and within a team) it effectively takes snapshots / backups of the work done, which introduces redundancy within your work, a method of fall back, and a way to look back at previous code as and when required.

A version control system also lets you make notes when you create a change, and the system will also let you easily see what has been changed, when it has been changed and who it has been changed by. By getting all this information it gives you a better insight on why something may have been done that way and by letting you know who has changed it, it lets you consult with them if required.

Version control systems have many features which allow working with a team to not be a problem. It allows numerous developers to work on the same project at any given time by letting developers merge their changes into the project and the system will notify the developer of any conflicts between the files / developers which need corrected.
