Why is a Version Control System useful when developing software both as an individual developer and as part of a development team?

A version control system is useful when developing both individually and within a team as along the way of your development (individually and within a team) it effectively takes snapshots / backups of the work done, which introduces redundancy within your work, a method of fall back, and a way to look back at previous code as and when required.

A version control system also lets you make notes when you create a change, and the system will also let you easily see what has been changed, when it has been changed and who it has been changed by. By getting all this information it gives you a better insight on why something may have been done that way and by letting you know who has changed it, it lets you consult with them if required.

Version control systems have many features which allow working with a team to not be a problem. It allows numerous developers to work on the same project at any given time by letting developers merge their changes into the project and the system will notify the developer of any conflicts between the files / developers which need corrected.

Version Control systems also make use of branches which allows you to create different versions of a project at one time, which is great for adding numerous different features as you can have a feature per branch. Once you are done your work in your branch what you need to do next is to merge it back into the main branch by using a pull request.

Pull requests are when you tell others you are wanting to make a change to a branch by merging your work into it. Pull requests are vital to working with a team as this allows others to view and approve your code, this creates healthy, consistent and easy to maintain bits of work / projects.

In summary, it is very important to use a Version Control system when developing as it provides numerous advantages to the developer(s) by simply acting as a backup, and by allowing yourself / others to review bits of work before they are committed into your main project to ensure your work meets your desired coding standards.
